# IRIFAB

IRIFAB (Improved rule inference for AnyBurl) is a application for inferencing the results of symbolic rules and create candidate rankings of them. It is based on the work of [AnyBURL](http://web.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/AnyBURL/) (Anytime Bottom Up Rule Learning), which is an algorithm for learning, applying and evaluating logical rules from large knowledge graphs in the context of link prediction.

There are two versions of the rule applicator. 
+ The ***CPU*** version is designed for the excecution on one or multiple CPU threads. 
+ The ***CUDA*** version was designed for the excecution on CUDA-capable GPU's, but does currently ***NOT*** work

## Build from source

1. Have cmake installed
2. Create folder **build** in {PATH_TO_PROJECT}/CPU/
3. Switch to {PATH_TO_PROJECT}/CPU/build
4. Run `cmake ../`

If building using Visual Studio
1. Open IRIFAB.sln
2. Select **Release** as build type
4. Click on **Build** â†’ **Build Solution**

Else
1. Run `make` from **build** folder

## Manual

To run IRIFAB a properties file called apply-config.properties is required as an startup argument.

#### Windows

`IRIFAB.exe apply-config.properties`

#### Linux

`./IRIFAB apply-config.properties`

#### Properties file

An overview of the format and possible parameters can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenBioLink/IRIFAB/wiki/Properties-file).

## Performance

Performance test performed on an Intel i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz, 2 Cores, 4 Logical Processors. (Averaged over 10 runs)

Each test was run with the following properties:

```
UNSEEN_NEGATIVE_EXAMPLES = 5
TOP_K_OUTPUT = 10
WORKER_THREADS = 3
```

The column "Configuration" shows the different configurations of the following properties:

```
FAST DISCRIMINATION_UNIQUE INTERMEDIATE_DISCRIMINATION DISCRIMINATION_BOUND
```

While 0 1 0 is closest to the original implementation and 1 0 1 is the fastest.

*) You cannot actually set these  parameters (FAST DISCRIMINATION_UNIQUE INTERMEDIATE_DISCRIMINATION DISCRIMINATION_BOUND) in the AnyBURL implementation. Here 0 1 0 just represents a run with the original AnyBURL implementation and the specified DISCRIMINATION_BOUND set.
